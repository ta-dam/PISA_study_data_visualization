# PISA 2012 data exploration
## by Tatjana Damdinshaw


## Dataset

PISA is a survey that already took place the 5th time in 2012 to assess the competencies in reading, mathematics and science (focus on mathematics) of 15 year-old students in 65 countries and economies. This dataset contains the information for each student.
There are 485490 student PISA results with 636 features. Most of the features are answers to survey questions answered by the participating students and are ordered factor variables with Agree, Strongly agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree or a numeric scale. Numeric variables are the resulting score in the different categories.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The influence of math anxiety and out-of-school learning hours towards the math PISA score in general and per gender.


## Summary of Findings

There is a strong relation between feeling anxious about math and scoring low in math or in total. The more students disagree with questions of the survey about math anxiety the better they scored in math. Female students feel more anxious about math than male students.
Surprisingly out-of-school learning hours do not have an influence on the math or total score. Some students score on a high level with high numbers of out-of-school learning hours but there are also students that learn a lot of hours outside of school but still do not score on a high level.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Math anxiety per gender
- Influence of math anxiety in general on the math score
- Math anxiety survey question answers in relation to the math score for one selected question
